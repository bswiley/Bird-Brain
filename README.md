# Bird-Brain

## Description

Unfortunately, this repository is still a work in progress.  We are still in the process of creation.  Come back soon to give it a try!

Bird-Brain is a social media app where a user can comment and start a conversation with other people who love birds.  The complete application is in the folder containing this README and can be downloaded and installed locally (assuming the user has node.js and Mongo DB installed on their local machine) but we recommend using the copy already deployed to heroku. [add link here!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!###################!!!!!!!!!!!!}  It was built around a full MERN (mongoDB, Express, React, Node) stack with Apollo and Graph Ql connecting the front end to the back end.

## Installation

Again, Bird-Brain has also been deployed to heroku{add link here!!!!!#############!!!!!!!!!!!], but if desired it can also be downloaded from this git repository and deployed locally.  The deployed version makes API calls to the Nuthatch API, so to use it locally a key would have to be requested from them.  Understanding that to install it locally it is required that the user:
1. Request an API key from the Nuthatch API <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<link to site!!!!!.  A the time of this apps creation this was an easy matter.  All that is required is that you give and email address and a sort answer to the question "How will you use this api?" Almost immediately after submitting the form an API key will be sent to your email address. 

2. clone the repository into a folder in your local drive. 

3. with your terminal, enter into the folder where the repository was saved. 

4. create a '.env' file and fill it out accordingly

		KEY = 'cut and past the API key from your email here'
		SECRET = 'type any random text here (even this text will work)'

5. run "npm run install".  This is important because using just "npm install" may not install all the required dependencies. 

6. run "npm run Develop".  This will start the server and pull up the website in your browser.

7. Enjoy!

## Usage

After running "npm run Develoop" or clicking on this link (addd link here!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!####################!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!), the user will see birds that have already provoked a discussion and a search bar.  After typing a bird name (or partial name) in the search bar and hitting "Submit Search", the user  will get a list of one or more images of birds to choose from.  Hit the "Create Post" button to add your text to the bird.  After submitting the text with the bird, this bird and your "post" will be added to the list of Posts that are there for other users to view and comment upon.
